        \resumeItem{Objective}
          {Data mine and perform a data set consisting of ultrasound patients that have experienced traumatic brain injuries to build a model that predicts internal or external bleeding.}
        \resumeItem{Data Processing}
          {Used Matlab to organize and perform calculations on 3 dimensional matrix for both CT scan and ultrasound imaging data. Both tissue density data sets were used to identify patterns that might help make patient head injury status predictions.}
        \resumeItem{Dimensionality Reduction}
          {Performed Principle Component Analysis and singular value decomposition to identify reduced approximation of the ultrasound data.}
