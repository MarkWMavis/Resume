        \resumeItem{Objective}{Research the impact that image color balance variation has on machine learning model accuracy.}
        \resumeItem{Machine Learning}
          {Using Tensorflows' Keras deep learning API, I trained various models to identify objects in multiple image data sets. }
        \resumeItem{Computer Vision}
          {Using Pythons Computer Vision library, I stripped images into delimited files containing rows of pixel RGB values representing each image then input into model for training, testing, and validation.}
        \resumeItem{Data Processing}
          {Using a well established image data set from Kaggle, I duplicated the set and applied alterations to better understand the effects of lighting conditions on the ML model. Used Scikit-Learn library to randomized data set to reduce bias training.}
        \resumeItem{Data Analysis}
          {Using the Matplotlib library to analyse various model iterations to compared to each other. I was able to demonstrate that you could improve your models accuracy by approx. 11\% by matching the color balance of both the trained images and the test and validation images.}
